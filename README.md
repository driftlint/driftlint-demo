# driftlint-demo

This is a client-ready demo repository for Driftlint. It contains multiple API implementations in different stacks to show how Driftlint detects API drift and generates OpenAPI specs during the pull request workflow.

Key points:
- Each API example intentionally does NOT include an OpenAPI YAML file in the repo.
- When you open a pull request, Driftlint will autogenerate spec files for each service and attach them to the PR.
- The goal is to showcase how teams can keep specs in sync without manually maintaining them in the codebase.

## What is included
- Flask: simple Orders API
- FastAPI: simple Support Tickets API
- PHP: simple Customers API
- TypeScript Express: simple Invoices API

Each app includes a realistic edge case to reflect real-world behavior (validation, de-duplication, or consistency checks).

## Repo layout
- `FlaskAPI/` Flask app (orders)
- `FastAPI/` FastAPI app (tickets)
- `PhP/` PHP app (customers)
- `Typescript-express/` TypeScript Express app (invoices)

## Driftlint in the PR flow
1. Open a PR against this repo.
2. Driftlint runs and inspects each API implementation.
3. Autogenerated OpenAPI specs appear in the PR as generated artifacts.
4. Reviewers can validate drift or approve updated specs.

This demonstrates how Driftlint can be introduced into existing services without requiring manual spec maintenance upfront.
